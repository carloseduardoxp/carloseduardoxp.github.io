# About Me

I am currently working as a Software Engineering Professor at the [Federal Institute of Science and Technology at Triângulo Mineiro (IFTM)](https://iftm.edu.br/), in Uberlândia/MG since 2014. Additionally, I am Ph.D. candidate at the [Computing Faculty (FACOM)](http://www.portal.facom.ufu.br/) of the [Federal University of Uberlândia](http://www.ufu.br/) under the supervision of Professor [Marcelo de Almeida Maia at the Intelligent Software Engineering Lab](http://www.isel.ufu.br/). I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from [UFU](http://www.ufu.br/), which I completed in 2017.  My undergraduate studies were in Computer Engineering at the [State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG - 2005)](https://www.uemg.br/ituiutaba). Furthermore, I have specialized in Java Development at [UNITRI](https://unitri.edu.br/) in 2007 and obtained the Sun Certified Java Programmer certification (SCJP) in the same year. I have nine years of industry experience as a professional software developer from 2006 to 2014. My primary research interests lie in software repository mining for program comprehension and recommendation systems for software development.
